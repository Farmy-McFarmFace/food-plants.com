                <h2>About Our Market Garden</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Food Plants, where we are passionate about growing nutritious, flavorful produce using sustainable and regenerative farming practices. Our farm is more than just a business—it's a commitment to healthy food, healthy soil, and a healthy community.</p>

                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Founded with a vision to bring fresh produce directly to our local community, our market garden has been serving families, restaurants, and local businesses with the highest quality vegetables, fruits, and herbs. We believe that food should be grown with respect for the land and the people who eat it.</p>

                <h3>Our Farming Philosophy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Natural Methods:</strong> We never use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Our crops are grown naturally, allowing them to develop their full flavor and nutritional value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soil Health:</strong> We focus on building healthy, living soil through composting, cover cropping, and minimal tillage practices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Our garden is designed to support a diverse ecosystem, with beneficial insects, native plants, and wildlife habitats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Conservation:</strong> We use efficient irrigation methods and mulching techniques to conserve water and protect this precious resource.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal Growing:</strong> We work with nature's rhythms, growing crops that are in season and at their peak flavor.</li>
                </ul>
